## How to view the dashboards

1. Open the project folder you want to view (e.g. `projects/project-1`).
2. See `dashboard.png` for a static screenshot.
3. Follow the link in `pbix-link.txt` to download or view the PBIX if available (OneDrive/SharePoint or Power BI Service).

## What each project contains

Each project folder includes:
- `project-repo-link.txt` — link to GitHub folder or full project page
- `README.md` — problem statement, dataset, data model summary, steps to reproduce, key visuals and insights.
- `dashboard.png` — a screenshot of the final report.
- `pbix-link.txt` — link to the PBIX file (if shareable) or hosting notes.
