2. See `dashboard.png` for a static screenshot.
3. Follow the link in `pbix-link.txt` to download or view the PBIX if available (OneDrive/SharePoint or Power BI Service).

## What each project contains

Each project folder includes:
- `project-repo-link.txt` — link to GitHub folder or full project page
